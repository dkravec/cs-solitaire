## About
This is a project to help me learn C#, so the code may not be perfect. And some earlier commits may be confusing compared to what the final project with be, since i would be testing random stuff.

## Usage
Run "dotnet run" in the terminal with the project root folder as your entry point. this will automatically run Program.cs

## Version history
### 1.0 (1.2022.06.01)
- created base program.
- created a "Deck" class (also helped with learning classes in c#).
    - this will be used to keep data and functions to change those data easier.
- created layout for drawcards, which will be the terminal screen eventually.
- The program basically does nothing at this moment.
